## Event build log

## 2026-10-10T22:03:32+05:30 — Add one-agent Computer Use test

- Changed: Added `test/computer-use-agent.mjs`, `test/package.json`, and `test/README.md`; updated the root README with runnable project details.
- Why: Provide a minimal, interactive test of a single Agents API agent using an OpenAI-hosted browser and public documentation.
- Validation: `npm install` added `openai@7.32.0` with no reported vulnerabilities; `npm run check` passed; importing the SDK and checking the required session and event methods succeeded. The installed SDK requires Node.js 22 while this workspace currently has Node.js 18.18.0, so a live run was not attempted.
- Limitations: The live run requires Node.js 22 or newer, an interactive terminal, a permitted OpenAI API key, and explicit origin approval. It does not test sign-in or website-changing actions.

## Template setup — 10 October 2026

- Changed: Added the event README, rules, agent guide, change log, AI usage record, submission checklist, Git ignore rules, and pull request checklist.
- Why: Give participants a consistent starting point for event rules, basic coding patterns, documented changes, and regular commits.
- Validation: Checked local Markdown links, event detail consistency, required documents, and diff whitespace before publishing.
- Limitations: Documentation scaffolding only; no participant project, application, or working demo is included. GitHub publication and template status are verified separately after creation.
